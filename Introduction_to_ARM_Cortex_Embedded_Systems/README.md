# ARM Cortex-M Embedded Systems

This repository is based on the first book in a series of three that teaches the fundamentals of embedded systems applied to the ARM Â® CortexTM-M family of microcontrollers. The focus of this first book is an introduction to computers and interfacing, with a focus on assembly language and C programming.

## Book Overview

- **Book 1**: Introduction to computers and interfacing, focusing on assembly language and C programming.
- **Book 2**: Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers, focusing on hardware/software interfacing and embedded system design.
- **Book 3**: Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers, an advanced book on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics.

This first book is an introductory text suitable for use at the college level, with little or no prerequisites.
