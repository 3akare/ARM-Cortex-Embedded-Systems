# ARM Cortex-M Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing

This repository is based on the second book in a series of three that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to the ARM ® CortexTM-M family of microcontrollers. The books are primarily written for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students but can also be used by professionals learning the ARM platform.

## Book Overview

- **Book 1**: *Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers* — An introduction to computers and interfacing, focusing on assembly language and C programming.
- **Book 2**: *Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers* — Focuses on hardware/software interfacing and the design of embedded systems.
- **Book 3**: *Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers* — An advanced book on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics.

This second book focuses on interfacing and the design of embedded systems, bridging the gap between theory and practical applications for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
