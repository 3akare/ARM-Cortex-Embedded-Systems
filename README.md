# ARM Cortex-M Embedded Systems Series

This repository is based on a series of three books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to the ARM Cortex-M family of microcontrollers. The series is designed for students and professionals in the field of electrical and computer engineering. Each book covers a different aspect of embedded systems, starting with the basics and progressing to advanced topics.

## Book Overview

1. **Book 1: Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers**  
   An introductory book that covers computers and interfacing, focusing on assembly language and C programming. It is suitable for beginners with little or no prior experience in embedded systems.

2. **Book 2: Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers**  
   Focuses on hardware/software interfacing and the design of embedded systems. It is aimed at undergraduate students or professionals who wish to deepen their understanding of embedded system design.

3. **Book 3: Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers**  
   An advanced book that delves into operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics. It is primarily targeted at senior undergraduate or graduate students, and professionals looking to design or deploy a real-time operating system onto an ARM platform.

## Target Audience

- **Book 1**: Suitable for beginners or those new to ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers and embedded systems.
- **Book 2**: Intended for students and professionals who want to learn about interfacing and embedded system design.
- **Book 3**: Aimed at advanced students and professionals interested in real-time operating systems, control systems, and robotics.

Each book in this series builds on the knowledge of the previous one, taking readers from introductory concepts to more complex embedded system design and real-time operating systems.
