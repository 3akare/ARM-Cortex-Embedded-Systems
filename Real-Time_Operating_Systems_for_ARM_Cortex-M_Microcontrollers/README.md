# ARM Cortex-M Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems

This repository is based on the third book in a series of three that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to the ARM Cortex-M family of microcontrollers. This volume is primarily written for senior undergraduate or first-year graduate electrical and computer engineering students but can also be used by professionals wishing to design or deploy a real-time operating system onto an ARM platform.

## Book Overview

- **Book 1**: *Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers* — An introduction to computers and interfacing, focusing on assembly language and C programming.
- **Book 2**: *Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers* — Focuses on hardware/software interfacing and the design of embedded systems.
- **Book 3**: *Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers* — An advanced book on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics.

This third book focuses on real-time operating systems and their applications in embedded systems, making it ideal for advanced students and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
